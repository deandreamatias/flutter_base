# Testing notes

## TODO List

- [ ] Define test structure and nomenclature and descriptions 
- [ ] Mock all service not only repositories. We can use same implementation for not adding service class directly to RegisterModule
- [ ] To have full control over mocked data we should find a way to use a Mockito type library or similar
- [ ] Define a way to use keys without hardcoded strings
